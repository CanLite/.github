# 🌐 CanLite Proxy Network

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **CanLite Proxy Network**, the powerhouse behind [CanLite.org](https://canlite.org), and a host for **BrunysIXL** — two dynamic platforms committed to **internet freedom**, **student empowerment**, and **web accessibility**.

---

## 🚀 Our Mission

The CanLite Proxy Network is dedicated to maintaining **unrestricted, secure, and fast** access to blocked or censored content, especially in **educational and restrictive environments**. We believe in the **right to explore**, **play**, **learn**, and **connect** — no matter where you are.

## 🌍 Our Ecosystem

### 🔗 [CanLite.org](https://canlite.org)

CanLite.org is a modern, student-centric web portal that includes:

- 🕹 **Hundreds of HTML5 Games**  
  Ranging from action, puzzle, and adventure to retro classics and indie hits. All optimized to run in-browser and bypass restrictions.

- 🌐 **Web Proxy Access**  
  Fully functional proxy service that allows users to browse blocked websites using industry-standard obfuscation techniques. Regular updates and route expansions help evade deep packet inspection and filter evasion systems.

- 💾 **Cloud Save System**  
  Save your game progress in the cloud and resume anytime, anywhere.

- 🧩 **Regular Updates and New Game Uploads**  
  The site is updated frequently to stay ahead of network restrictions and deliver fresh content.
